## Getting Started

There are no many prerequisites for this application. My suggestion is to use a Visual Studio Code.

* [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) - Extension that I use, version 4.
* [Font Awesome] (https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon kit that I used, an a external script link.
